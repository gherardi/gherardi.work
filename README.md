This is the repository of [gherardi](http://www.gherardi.work/) portfolio.

## Overview

The front end of the portfolio was made with plain [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework for his awesome performance and accessibility, for interactive components I used a combination of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [React](https://react.dev/). To generate our static files that will be uploaded to the environment I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Getting Started

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your machine, these are our only dependencies to run the project locally.

```sh
# Clone the project.
git clone https://github.com/gherardi/gherardi.work.git

# Install npm depedencies.
npm install

# Run the website.
npm start
```
